  title: Whispers of Steel
  lines: That blade you've got there... it's sturdy enough, but I've heard whispers
    of a special ore found in the Whisperwood. They say it glows with a faint blue
    light, and weapons made from it are sharper than any other. Just a rumor, probably...
    but if you do find some, bring it to me. I'd pay a good price.
